QTracker_prod is a set of learning scripts that is more closely representative of the real production version.  Start with QTracker_basic and learn
what its doing, then explore the data generation and training here.  QTracker_prod.py used the most updated version of the RUS file while QTracker_basic uses only a limited version with limited variables.  QTracker_basic is meant to be very simple just for getting started and will not be updated for further data features and improved handling.
